    <p>Ashford</p>
    <br>
    <p>Deep in the earth your little bones</p>
    <p>your little hands your little feet</p>
    <p>in restless repose unfastening loops</p>
    <p>calling for bread and potato soup</p>
    <p>a shock of light struck the valve</p>
    <p>milk of the lamb poured from the side</p>
    <p>and a terrible mist rose underfoot</p>
    <p>you were all snow white</p>
    <p>and I the seventh dwarf</p>
    <p>prepared to serve you</p>
    <p>there were wafers enough</p>
    <p>for every living thing</p>
    <p>who offered his tongue</p>
    <p>there were no more cries</p>
    <p>there was no fastening heart</p>
    <p>Only the relics of consumption</p>
    <p>wrapped in the silk of existence</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith, Patti</p>
